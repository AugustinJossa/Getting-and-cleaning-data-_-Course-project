# Getting-and-cleaning-data-_-Course-project
This repo is for the evaluation of the Coursera's "Getting and Cleaning Data class" course project 

##The program will :
- Download a zip file in your working directory: getdata_dataset
- Extract the content of the zip file in your working directory : UCI HAR Dataset
- Create a text file with the tidy data in your working directory : tidy.file

## Here are the different steps of this program
- Downloads the data
- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
